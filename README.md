# tmills-file

Just a simple CLI app I made in rust, built only with the standard library and having 3 functions that can be used:

- read / -r
- write / -w
- overwrite / -ow

To use the application, simply run it from the command-line and type the following

```cmd
tmills-file [flag] [file-path] [input?] <- input takes a string only atm. "Anything in quotes"
```

Im sure people can also link this application to their PATH environment variables to run it anywhere on your system

Enjoy!
